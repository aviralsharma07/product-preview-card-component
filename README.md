## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Netlify

### What I learned

1. Sometimes Padding is enough to align thing, setting margin is not required.

### Continued development

Moving ahead:
- I will learn to use media queries to make sites responsive in Mobiles.
- I want to create more complex projects by improving grasp on Flexbox, positioning and typography.
